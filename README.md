# Overview
The programs that I made go over the basic structures of Java. They touch on variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and array lists. The main program that I made creates an array list and allows you to add a certain amount of names to the list. It then takes the list and loops through it displaying the names in the array list.

The purpose for me to create this software was to expand my programming language experience.
